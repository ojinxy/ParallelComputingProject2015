# Installation Instructions
    This is a C programming project which uses PVM to parallelize an application to have the application run on multiple processors (computers). This allows users to get super computer speeds by attaching less expensive machines to a network.
    
    1. You need to install PVM. (http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/)
    2. Run the following command to compile source code. (cc -L~/pvm3/lib/ARCH tspleast.c -lpvm3 -o tspleast)
    3. Run the application using either xpvm or pvm.
